# Amazon-Review-Sentiment-Analysis
## Purpose of Statement 
Customer reviews and ratings reflect the writer's sentiment toward a product, which can be positive, negative, or neutral. Some customers give four or five stars to express satisfaction, while others give one or two stars to convey dissatisfaction, making it easy to discern emotions. However, when people assign three stars, it's not clear whether they are content or not, causing confusion for both consumers and businesses trying to understand feedback and customer satisfaction. This study aims to predict the neutrality of Amazon mobile phone reviews by analyzing sentiment, leaving the three-star rating as neutral. The goal is to assess advanced NLP models like BERT in handling complex categorization challenges. Four machine-learning models with different feature extraction techniques, namely Logistic Regression, Linear Support Vector, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest, will be employed. The most effective model will be examined for sentiment categorization. Finally, the best-performing model will be retrained without the neutral class, transforming the problem into a binary-classification task to evaluate its performance under this new context.
